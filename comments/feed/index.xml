Hi, everything you need to perform decryption should be contained in the backup. I need to update this post a little as PPV has changed things recently (Aug 2021).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I Hey Mike,
I really appreciate the write up on this. I&#039;m in the same boat as Matt K. above. I have an iPhone backup that I&#039;ve extracted the PPV app data from and need some assistance decrypting it. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I&#039;ll reach out via Discord also. Thanks!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Really interesting read Mike. I&#039;m just getting into looking at photos.sqlite, Does IOS actually store any images in photos.sqlite, as BLOBs? If so do you have any recommendations on how to extract if I&#039;m using commandline or sqlitestudio...it&#039;s all I have at the moment.]]></description>

Hi Mike,

Really interesting blog post!

I have similiar problem as Matt. I still have my old iphone backup but switched to android so I cant restore the PPV app.

Is there a way to extract the key from the keychain-backup.plist somehow?]]></description>
