It was first used in the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"TraceTogether (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tracetogether.gov.sg\/\" target=\"_blank\">TraceTogether<\/a> app in Singapore beginning in March 2020. <br><br>Encounters between devices are only tracked locally and must be uploaded to AHS manually (and <em>voluntarily<\/em>) if they contact you and request you to do so. In my tests the app did not communicate with the server any more than necessary (such as to retrieve encrypted forward-dated Temp IDs).<br><br>Analysis of the tracing database did not net any information of significant forensic value. Encounters between devices are logged however the only information available is: 1) the other device&#8217;s make and model, 2) the host device&#8217;s make and model, 3) the time of the interaction, 4) indicators of how close the device came such as received signal strength indicator (RSSI). The remaining data is encrypted and not accessible without keys that AHS maintains.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the BlueTrace design, the server (and its security) is of utmost importance. While out of scope for this article, I think it is worth noting that given all encryption keys, IDs, tempIDs, and registered phone numbers are stored on the server, any sort of poorly configured or insecure endpoints could pose the largest risk (such as in the event of a data breach).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, the app appears to deliver on its privacy promises. I did not find much of potential forensic value in artifacts from the app&#8217;s sandbox.  The app&#8217;s biggest failing, I think, is the requirement (iOS only) to keep the phone <strong>unlocked with the screen active <\/strong>at all times. I just can&#8217;t see people doing  this &#8211; they will be on their phones, which will mean this app isn&#8217;t in  the foreground and thus not working. I do acknowledge this limitation is not the fault of the developer, but rather the restrictiveness of iOS. Hopefully future development, such as with the recently released Apple\/Google <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"contact tracing API (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/covid19\/contacttracing\" target=\"_blank\">contact tracing API<\/a>, the need for leaving the device unlocked can be eliminated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color\"><strong>UPDATE 2020-05-02<\/strong>: As pointed out by user Chris Thompson (@yegct), another curiosity is that the OpenTrace project seems to be using a GPL license, which would be potentially problematic as this license dictates anything it ships with be licensed under GPL as well. I found <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"this github issue (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/opentrace-community\/opentrace-ios\/issues\/2\" target=\"_blank\">this github issue<\/a> on the repo also questioning the same.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"http:\/\/3.88.229.156\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/image-4.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"988\" height=\"246\" src=\"http:\/\/3.88.229.156\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/image-4.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-538\" srcset=\"http:\/\/172.31.17.250\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/image-4.png 988w, http:\/\/172.31.17.250\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/image-4-300x75.png 300w, http:\/\/172.31.17.250\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/image-4-768x191.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 988px) 100vw, 988px\" \/><\/a><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Static analysis<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I obtained a copy of the app (version 1.0.0) on my test iPhone 6S running iOS 13.2.2. I used <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"frida  (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.frida.re\" target=\"_blank\">frida <\/a>to obtain a copy of the IPA with a decrypted app binary and then used Hopper (macOS) to examine it. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It appears to be a small, straightforward app with not a lot of code to examine. It&#8217;s written in Swift which makes the static analysis a bit less intuitive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The app uses a library called <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"OpenTrace (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/opentrace-community\/opentrace-ios\" target=\"_blank\">OpenTrace<\/a> (which is an implementation of <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"BlueTrace (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/bluetrace.io\/\" target=\"_blank\">BlueTrace<\/a>). BlueTrace has published <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" aria-label=\"a whitepaper (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/bluetrace.io\/static\/bluetrace_whitepaper-938063656596c104632def383eb33b3c.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">a whitepaper<\/a> explaining the technical methodology and, I feel gives very solid explanations for why things are the way they are. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color has-vivid-green-cyan-color\"><strong>UPDATE 2020-05-02<\/strong>: Just a minor clarification on the above paragraph &#8211; rather than consuming any pre-compiled library or framework, it appears that the OpenTrace code has been integrated directly with the ABTraceTogether codebase under the ABTraceTogether class. This does not mean there aren&#8217;t variations. However, I did test several strings from debug messages found in the OpenTrace code and located all of them unmodified in the ABTraceTogetherApp binary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Info.plist<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The app&#8217;s Info.plist contains some interesting info, such as developer specified descriptions for permissions potentially requested.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription &#8211; <\/strong>ABTraceTogether exchanges Bluetooth signals with nearby phones running the same app. These signals contain an anonymised ID, which is encrypted and changes continually to ensure your privacy. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>NSCameraUsageDescription<\/strong> &#8211; Grant ABTraceTogether permissions to access your camera if you would like to upload a photo as part of a support request<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription<\/strong> &#8211; Grant ABTraceTogether permissions to access your photo library if you would like to upload a photo as part of a support request<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plist also specifies that at a minimum, iOS 13 is required. This requirement was interesting to me because the app does not use the new Apple\/Google API. It could limit the ability for people using older hardware that can&#8217;t run iOS 13 to access it. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, nothing super surprising here. The camera\/photo gallery permissions didn&#8217;t come up in any of my tests.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>Nothing else of note resulting from static analysis.
