					<description><![CDATA[Really interesting read Mike. I&#039;m just getting into looking at photos.sqlite, Does IOS actually store any images in photos.sqlite, as BLOBs? If so do you have any recommendations on how to extract if I&#039;m using commandline or sqlitestudio...it&#039;s all I have at the moment.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/05/02/ios-photos-sqlite-forensics/#comment-356&quot;&gt;Dili P&lt;/a&gt;.

Hmm. Looks like Photos.sqlite in Catalina and later has the same structure as Photos.sqlite in iOS, but different from that in Mojave and earlier. I wonder then how Photos Takeout app for Mac manages to extract albums and other stuff from Mac Photos for Catalina as well as Mojave.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Good read. Very useful insights! What about the database for Photos app for Mac? I can right click the Photos Library in Pictures, select Show Package Contents, and open the database (It&#039;s different in Catalina and pre-Catalina). Now the problem: If you rearrange photos within a user-created album, and then export the album into a folder on desktop, the manual reordering sequence is lost. So, Photos is obviously storing the information pertaining to the album sequencing somewhere. For the life of me, I can&#039;t figure out where. Any clues? Thanks!]]></description>
